To run various algorithms:
python eval_triage.py -f filename -l lambda -s error_probability -o option 
To check plots:
python plot_triage_real.py -f filename -l lambda -s error_probability 

The list of file name and list of options in code/eval_triage.py contains the possible list of file names and options. Lambda and error probability values are mentioned in paper. error probability = 0.0 for hatespeech.
